I am Associate Professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Toronto, with an affiliation to the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy. I obtained my PhD in 2013 from the University of Montreal in Canada. 

My interest is in data science, in particular machine learning and methods for "text as data." I teach statistical methods and Canadian politics. In my free time, I study markets.

<br/>

**Interests:** Computational Social Science; Machine Learning; Quantitative Methods.
